## Setup

To quickly set up the project, use the following single command:
It encompases all below steps just copy and throw it in terminal, and you will be good to go

```sh
git clone git@github.com:imsamad/DecorDelight && cd DecorDelight && npm install && docker compose up -d && npm run copy:env && npm run db:generate && npx turbo run build -F=@repo/* && npm run db:seed && npm run dev
```

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/imsamad/DecorDelight && cd DecorDelight && npm install
   ```

2. Start MongoDB Instance. If you donâ€™t have Docker installed, you can use a cloud instance.

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Copy environment variables:

   ```sh
   npm run copy:env
   ```

4. Generate Prisma Client:

   ```sh
   npm run db:generate
   ```

5. Build all packages. This step is required due to the JIT compilation strategy used with Turborepo.

   ```sh
   npx turbo run build -F=@repo/*
   ```

6. Seed dummy data:

   ```sh
   npm run db:seed
   ```

   ```
